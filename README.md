# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment analysis or opinion mining is one of the major tasks of NLP (Natural Language Processing).
# Concepts Used
# 1.Tokenization
Tokenization is the process of converting text into tokens before transforming it into vectors. It is also easier to filter out unnecessary tokens.
# 2.Stop Words  Removal
Stop words are the most commonly occurring words which are not relevant in the context of the data and do not contribute any deeper meaning to the phrase. These contains no sentiment. NLTK provide a library used for this.
# Stemming and Lematizing
Stemming and Lemmatization are Text Normalization (or sometimes called Word Normalization) techniques in the field of Natural Language Processing that are used to prepare text, words, and documents for further processing.
# Count Vectorizer
The Count vectorizer provides a simple way to both tokenize a collection of text documents and build a vocabulary of known words, but also to encode new documents using that vocabulary.
# Algorithms used
  1. Random Forest Classifier
  2. Logistic Regression
  3. Naive Bayes
  4. Support Vector Machine
  5. K Neighbour Classifier
